        <p class="text-center text-gray-500 mb-12 border-b pb-8">Last Updated: December 17, 2025</p>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <p class="mb-4">Thank you for choosing VA Horizon. We are committed to providing high-quality virtual
                assistant services. However, we understand that there may be circumstances where you need to cancel your
                service or request a refund. This policy outlines the terms and conditions for refunds, cancellations,
                and our replacement guarantee.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">1. Definitions</h2>
            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>"Service"</strong> refers to the virtual assistant services provided by VA Horizon.</li>
                <li><strong>"Setup Fee"</strong> refers to the one-time fee charged for recruiting, vetting, and
                    onboarding a virtual assistant.</li>
                <li><strong>"Subscription Fee"</strong> refers to the recurring monthly fee for the virtual assistant's
                    services.</li>
                <li><strong>"Client"</strong> refers to the individual or entity purchasing the Service.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">2. Setup Fees</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">The Setup Fee covers the immediate costs associated with sourcing, interviewing, background
                checking, and training a dedicated virtual assistant for your specific needs. This process begins
                immediately upon your payment.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Therefore, Setup Fees are non-refundable once the onboarding process has
                    commenced.</strong> The onboarding process is deemed to have commenced 24 hours after payment is
                received or when we present you with candidate profiles, whichever occurs first.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">3. Subscription Services & Cancellation</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">VA Horizon services are billed on a subscription basis. You will be billed in advance on a
                recurring and periodic basis (such as monthly).</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Cancellation Policy</h3>
            <p class="mb-4">You may cancel your subscription at any time by providing us with at least <strong>30 days'
                    written notice</strong> via email to <a href="mailto:youssef@vahorizon.site"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">youssef@vahorizon.site</a>.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Your service will continue until the end of the 30-day notice period, and you will be billed
                for this final period. No refunds will be issued for partial months of service or for periods where the
                Client did not utilize the available services.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>All worked hours are non-refundable.</strong> For clarity, any hours the Virtual
                Assistant has already worked during a billing period — including time spent on tasks, training, or
                onboarding — will not be eligible for refund.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4 text-[#082541]">4. 5-Day Replacement Guarantee</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We strive to match you with the perfect Virtual Assistant. However, if you are not satisfied
                with the performance of your assigned Virtual Assistant within the first <strong>5 business
                    days</strong> of their start date, we offer a Replacement Guarantee.</p>
            <h3 class="text-xl mb-2 font-bold">How it works:</h3>
            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li><strong>Notification:</strong> You must notify us in writing at <a
                        href="mailto:youssef@vahorizon.site"
                        class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">youssef@vahorizon.site</a> within the first 5 business
                    days
                    of the VA's start date.</li>
                <li><strong>Replacement:</strong> We will immediately begin the process of finding a replacement VA for
                    you at no additional Setup Fee.</li>
                <li><strong>Credit:</strong> We will credit the unused portion of your first month's Subscription Fee
                    towards the new VA's service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Note:</strong> This guarantee entitles you to a replacement VA, not a cash refund of
                fees paid.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">5. Refunds for Service Failure</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">In the unlikely event that VA Horizon is unable to provide the Service due to our own
                operational failure (e.g., we cannot find a suitable candidate within 30 days of payment), you will be
                entitled to a full refund of all fees paid, including the Setup Fee.</p>
            <p class="mb-4">Refunds will be processed to the original method of payment within 5-10 business days.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">6. Chargebacks and Disputes</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We are committed to resolving any billing issues directly with our clients. If you believe a
                charge is incorrect, please contact us immediately at <a href="mailto:youssef@vahorizon.site"
                    class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">youssef@vahorizon.site</a>.</p>
            <p class="mb-4"><strong>Unjustified Chargebacks:</strong> If you initiate a chargeback with your credit card
                issuer or bank for a valid charge under these terms (e.g., a non-refundable Setup Fee or a Subscription
                Fee during the notice period), we reserve the right to:</p>
            <ul class="legal-list">
                <li>Immediately suspend all services.</li>
                <li>Dispute the chargeback with evidence of your agreement to these terms.</li>
                <li>Recover any costs associated with the dispute, including legal fees and administrative costs.</li>
                <li>Ban you from using VA Horizon services in the future.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h2 class="text-2xl mb-4">7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p class="mb-4">We reserve the right to modify this Refund Policy at any time. Changes and clarifications
                will take effect immediately upon their posting on the website. If we make material changes to this
                policy, we will notify you here that it has been updated, so that you are aware of what information we
                collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we use and/or disclose it.</p>
